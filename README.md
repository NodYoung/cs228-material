# Tutorials for Stanford cs228 and cs231n

Preparatory material for the probabilistic graphical models and the deep learning classes at Stanford.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A [tutorial](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb) on basic Python/Numpy that is necesseary to get started with the above machine learning classes.

You may follow the iPython notebook on github, or clone and execute it locally.
The notebook is based on an [earlier version](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) prepared by Justin Johnson.

##Modify the code to work under py3.4
**Python Numpy Tutorial** is very suitable for beginners to start your scientific computing with Python.
So I learn it. Besides, modify the code to work under py3.4.
